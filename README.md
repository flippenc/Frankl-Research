# Frankl's Conjecture Research

**General Research Information:**

-   A union-closed family is a collection of sets such that the union of
    any two sets in the family is also in the family. Frankl’s
    conjecture is a conjecture posed by Péter Frankl in 1979 which
    claims that for any union-closed family (besides the family
    consisting of only the empty set), there exists some element which
    appears in at least half of the sets of the family. This conjecture
    is widely believed to be true but it has remained an open problem

-   I worked on this research with Dr.Craig Larson from July 2022 to
    December 2023. During the Spring of 2023, this research fulfilled 2
    credits of SYSM 697 course credit. During the Fall of 2023, this
    research, including my thesis defense and submission, fulfilled 3
    credits of MATH 698 course credit

**Code Information:**

-   All of the code for this project was written using SageMath and each
    of the code files contains documentation comments. Some parts of
    this code requires use of
    [Conjecturing](http://nvcleemp.github.io/conjecturing/). More
    information about what Conjecturing does can be found in [this
    paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.01814)

-   The file `unionClosed.sage` contains functions to compute invariants
    about union-closed set families

-   The file `unionClosedFamilies.sage` contains constructors for
    various types of union-closed set families

-   The file `unionClosedProperties.sage` contains functions for
    checking various properties that union-closed families can have

-   The file `unionClosedUtilies.sage` contains various functions used
    by the other files as well as miscellaneous functions which were
    used to display union-closed families

**Presentations and Thesis Information:**

-   I gave my first presentation on this research during the VCU
    Discrete Math Seminar in April of 2023. The slides from this
    presentation are `Theory Development for Frankl’s Conjecture.pdf`
    and the flyer from this presentation is
    `Seminar Presentation Flyer.pdf`

-   I defended my thesis in November of 2023. The slides from my defense
    presentation are “Minimal Sets, Union-Closed Families, and Frankl’s
    Conjecture.pdf" and the flyer from this presentation is
    `Defense Presentation Flyer.pdf`

-   My Master’s thesis was submitted in December of 2023. The thesis,
    saved on this repository as `Thesis.pdf`, can also be found on the
    [VCU Scholars Compass](https://scholarscompass.vcu.edu/etd/7527/)
